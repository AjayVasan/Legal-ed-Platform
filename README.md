## 🏗️ System Architecture

```plaintext
[Frontend (React/Flask)]
       |
       ↓
[Flask API Layer (Python)]
       |
       ↓
[AI Modules: Vision, NLP, RL]
       |
       ↓
[Firebase (Auth + Sync) + MongoDB (Data)]
```

The Vision-Enhanced Gamified Platform is built on a modular and scalable architecture:
- **Flask Framework**: Lightweight web framework providing the API layer
- **Firebase**: Used for real-time storage, user authentication, and cloud synchronization
- **AI Services**: Intelligent features for clause extraction, question generation, and user behavior analysis

## 📚 Theoretical Framework

This platform integrates multiple educational and psychological theories:

- **Constructivist Learning Theory**: Knowledge is actively constructed by learners through meaningful interactions
- **Gamification & Self-Determination Theory**: Intrinsic motivation depends on autonomy, competence, and relatedness
- **Cognitive Load Theory**: Optimizing information presentation to enhance learning efficiency
- **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**: Designing natural and intuitive user interfaces

These theories guide the platform's design, ensuring that learners actively construct knowledge through interaction, reflection, and feedback.
